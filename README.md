## Overview  
<hr>

The purpose of this project is to build a more comprehensive collection of NFL player data.  The inspiration for this project came from past difficulties trying to obtain a high quality dataset.   Each resource that had been previouly reviewed has signficiant limits â€“ limited free datasets, limited time frame, and missing data.  The goal of this dataset is to provide a starting point for future projects.
